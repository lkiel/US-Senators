(Sec. 103) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that Congress, DOE, and energy industry participants should advance efforts to promote international, domestic, and regional cooperation on the research and development of energy innovations that:  provide clean, affordable, and reliable energy; promote economic growth; are critical for energy security; and  are sustainable without government support.   (Sec. 104) DOE shall ensure that laboratory operating contractors do not allocate costs of general and administrative overhead to laboratory-directed research and development. This prohibition does not apply to certain national security laboratories. (Sec. 105) DOE shall establish and maintain a public database, accessible on its website, containing a searchable listing of each unclassified research and development project contract, grant, cooperative agreement, task order for a federally funded research and development center, or other DOE-administered transaction.  DOE shall provide information through such database on relevant literature and patents that are associated with each such project contract, grant, or cooperative agreement, or other transaction, of DOE. (Sec. 106) Within one year of enactment of this bill and as often as determined to be necessary thereafter, DOE shall report on its ability to successfully transfer new energy technologies to the private sector.  (Sec. 107) DOE shall carry out the Agreements for Commercializing Technology pilot program in accordance with this bill, including by giving the contractors of the national laboratories increased authority to negotiate contract terms and making every such facility eligible for the program. The pilot program is extended through FY2019.  DOE shall permit the directors of the national laboratories to execute agreements with non-federal entities.   The bill: (1) subjects funding agreements to the requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act (concerning patent rights to inventions arising from federally-supported research and development), and (2) imposes contractor certification requirements for the avoidance of direct competition with the private sector and conflicts of interest.  (Sec. 108) The bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to exempt institutions of higher education and nonprofit institutions from the cost-sharing requirements for research and development for two years.  During such period, DOE shall submit an initial report, then subsequent annual reports, that describe the use of cost-sharing waivers by DOE with regard to carrying out research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs and activities that have been initiated since August 9, 2005.  TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESEARCH COORDINATION Department of Energy Research Coordination Act (Sec. 202) The bill amends the America Competes Act to require the following types of information collected by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) from recipients of financial assistance awards to be considered commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential and therefore not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act:   plans for commercialization of technologies developed under the award, investments provided to an awardee from third parties, additional financial support that the awardee plans to or has invested into the technology developed under the award or is seeking from third parties, and  revenue from the licensing or sale of new products or services that result from the research conducted under the award.   (Sec. 203) DOE shall use its capabilities to identify strategic opportunities for collaborative research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of innovative science and technologies.  DOE shall seek to leverage existing DOE programs and consolidate and coordinate activities throughout DOE to promote collaboration and crosscutting approaches within its programs.  Also, DOE shall:  prioritize activities that use all affordable domestic resources; develop a planning, evaluation, and technical assessment framework for setting long-term objective strategic goals and evaluating progress that ensures integrity and independence and provides the flexibility to adapt to market dynamics; ensure that activities do not duplicate other activities within DOE or other federal government activities; and  identify programs that may be more effectively left to the states, industry, nongovernmental organizations, institutions of higher education, or other stakeholders.   (Sec. 204) The bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require DOE, when periodically reviewing all of its science and technology activities in a strategic framework, to also take global energy dynamics into account under such a review.  Plans developed by DOE to improve coordination and collaboration in research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities across DOE's organizational boundaries shall also include:  critical assessments of any ongoing programs that have experienced subpar performance or cost overruns of 10% or more over 1 or more years; any activities that may be more effectively left to the states, industry, nongovernmental organizations, institutions of higher education, or other stakeholders; and  evaluations and proposals for innovation hubs, institutes, and research centers of DOE, including an affirmation that they will advance DOE's mission, prioritize research, development, and demonstration, and that those that are established or renewed within the Office of Science are consistent with its mission.   (Sec. 205) The bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require DOE to submit a report for FY2018 concerning the development and implementation of a strategy for facilities and infrastructure supported at certain DOE offices, the national laboratories, and single-purpose research facilities. (Sec. 206) DOE shall carry out a program to enhance economic, environmental, and energy security by making awards to consortia for the establishment and operation of Energy Innovation Hubs to conduct and support at one centralized location, multidisciplinary, collaborative research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of advanced energy technologies.  DOE shall: (1) designate a unique advanced energy technology basic research focus for each hub, and (2) ensure coordination and avoid unnecessary duplication of each hub's activities with those of other DOE research entities. To become eligible to receive an award to establish and operate a hub, a consortium must:  be composed of at least two qualifying entities; operate subject to a binding agreement, entered into by each consortium member, which documents the proposed partnership agreement, including the governance and management structure of the hub; and operate as a nonprofit organization.   Each hub shall conduct or provide for multidisciplinary, collaborative research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of advanced energy technologies.  In addition, each hub shall:  encourage collaboration and communication among the members of the qualifying entities of the consortium and awardees;  develop and publish proposed plans and programs on a publicly accessible website; submit annual reports to DOE summarizing its activities;  monitor project implementation and coordination; and maintain conflict of interest procedures, consistent with those of DOE.   TITLE III--DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF SCIENCE POLICY Department of Energy Office of Science Policy Act (Sec. 302) The bill states that the mission of the Office of Science shall be the delivery of scientific discoveries, capabilities, and major scientific tools to transform the understanding of nature and to advance U.S. energy, economic, and national security.  (Sec. 303) The Office of Science shall carry out an awards program to conduct fundamental and use-inspired energy research to accelerate scientific breakthroughs.   The office shall carry out a program for the development, construction, operation, and maintenance of national user facilities. Such facilities shall serve the needs of DOE, industry, the academic community, and other relevant entities in creating and examining materials and chemical processes for the purpose of improving U.S. competitiveness. Those facilities shall include x-ray light sources, neutron sources, nanoscale science research centers, and other appropriate facilities, consistent with the duties and responsibilities of the office under the Department of Energy Reorganization Act.

Crapo,R,ID,Sen.,https://api.propublica.org/congress/v1/members/C000880.json,[],"Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act TITLE I--IMPROVING CONSUMER ACCESS TO MORTGAGE CREDIT  (Sec. 101) This bill amends the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to allow a depository institution or credit union with assets below a specified threshold to forgo certain ability-to-pay requirements regarding residential mortgage loans. Specifically, those requirements are waived if a loan: (1) is originated by and retained by the institution, (2) complies with requirements regarding prepayment penalties and points and fees, and (3) does not have negative amortization or interest-only terms. Furthermore, for such requirements to be waived, the institution must consider and verify the debt, income, and financial resources of the consumer.  The bill also provides for circumstances in which such requirements shall be waived with respect to a loan that is transferred: (1) by reason of bankruptcy or failure of the originating institution, (2) to a similar institution, (3) in the event of a merger, or (4) to a wholly owned subsidiary of the institution.  (Sec. 102) Mortgage appraisal services donated by a fee appraiser to an organization eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions are deemed to be customary and reasonable under TILA.  (Sec. 103) The bill amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 to exempt from appraisal requirements certain federally related, rural real-estate transactions valued below a specified limit if no certified appraiser is available.  (Sec. 104) The bill amends the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 to exempt from specified public disclosure requirements depository institutions and credit unions that originate fewer than a specified number of closed-end mortgages or open-end lines of credit.  The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must report on these changes.  (Sec. 105) The bill amends the Federal Credit Union Act to allow a credit union to extend a member business loan with respect to a one- to four-family dwelling, regardless of whether the dwelling is the member's primary residence. Under current law, a member business loan may be extended with respect to such a dwelling only if it is the member's primary residence.  (Sec. 106) The bill amends the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 to revise the Act's civil liability immunity provisions and to temporarily allow loan originators that meet specified requirements to continue to originate loans after moving: (1) from one state to another, or (2) from a depository institution to a non-depository institution.  (Sec. 107) The bill amends TILA to specify that a retailer of manufactured housing that meets certain requirements is generally not a ""mortgage originator"" subject to requirements under that Act. (Sec. 108) The bill exempts from certain escrow requirements a residential mortgage loan held by a depository institution or credit union that: (1) has assets of $10 billion or less, (2) originated 1,000 or fewer mortgages in the preceding year, and (3) meets other specified requirements.  (Sec. 109) The required mortgage disclosure waiting period is eliminated with respect to a second offer of credit if the creditor offers a consumer a lower annual percentage rate in the second offer.  TITLE II--REGULATORY RELIEF AND PROTECTING CONSUMER ACCESS TO CREDIT (Sec. 201) Federal banking agencies must develop a specified Community Bank Leverage Ratio (the ratio of a bank's equity capital to its consolidated assets) for banks with assets of less than $10 billion. Such banks that exceed this ratio shall be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements. Federal banking agencies may consider a company's risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the ratio requirement.  (Sec. 202) The bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to exclude reciprocal deposits of an insured depository institution from certain limitations on prohibited broker deposits if the total reciprocal deposits of the institution do not exceed the lesser of $5 billion or 20% of its total liabilities. Reciprocal deposits are deposits that banks make with each other in equal amounts. (Generally, an insured depository institution that is not well capitalized may not accept funds obtained by or through any deposit broker for deposit.)  (Sec. 203) The bill amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to exempt from the ""Volcker Rule"" banks with: (1) total assets valued at less than $10 billion, and (2) trading assets and liabilities comprising not more than 5% of total assets. (The Volcker Rule prohibits banking agencies from engaging in proprietary trading or entering into certain relationships with hedge funds and private-equity funds.)  (Sec. 204) Volcker Rule restrictions on entity name sharing are eased in specified circumstances.  (Sec. 205) The bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require federal banking agencies to issue regulations allowing certain small depository institutions to satisfy reporting requirements with a reduced Report of Condition and Income (i.e., call report).  (Sec. 206) The bill amends the Home Owners' Loan Act to permit certain federal savings associations to elect to operate, subject to supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, with the same rights and duties as national banks (including operating without certain lending restrictions).  (Sec. 207) The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) must increase, from $1 billion to $3 billion, the consolidated asset threshold (i.e., permissible debt level) for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that: (1) is not engaged in significant nonbanking activities; (2) does not conduct significant off-balance-sheet activities; and (3) does not have a material amount of debt or equity securities, other than trust-preferred securities, outstanding. If warranted for supervisory purposes, the FRB may exclude a company from this threshold increase.  (Sec. 208) The bill amends the Expedited Funds Availability Act to apply the Act, which governs bank deposit holds, to American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. The Act's one-day extension for certain deposits in noncontiguous states or territories shall also apply to these territories.  (Sec. 209) The bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to reduce inspection requirements and environmental-review requirements for certain smaller, rural public-housing agencies.   (Sec. 210) The bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to increase the asset limit below which certain depository institutions are eligible for an 18-month, instead of a 12-month, examination cycle.  (Sec. 211) The bill creates the Insurance Policy Advisory Committee on International Capital Standards and Other Insurance Issues at the FRB. The FRB and the Department of the Treasury must report on: (1) their efforts regarding global insurance regulatory or supervisory forums, and (2) any final international insurance capital standards prior to adoption of such standards.  (Sec. 212) The bill amends the Federal Credit Union Act to require the National Credit Union Administration to hold public hearings on its draft annual budget.  (Sec. 213) A financial institution is authorized to record personal information from a scan, copy, or image of an individual's driver's license or personal identification card and store the information electronically when an individual initiates an online request to open an account or obtain a financial product. The financial institution may use the information for the purpose of verifying the authenticity of the driver's license or identification card, verifying the identity of the individual, or complying with legal requirements. The financial institution must delete any copy or image of an individual's driver's license or personal identification card after use. (Sec. 214) The bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to specify that a federal banking agency may not subject a depository institution to higher capital standards with respect to a high-volatility commercial real-estate (HVCRE) exposure unless the exposure is an HVCRE acquisition, development, or construction (ADC) loan. An HVCRE ADC loan : (1) is secured by land or improved real property; (2) has the purpose of providing financing to acquire, develop, or improve the real property such that the property becomes income-producing; and (3) is dependent upon future income or sales proceeds from, or refinancing of, the real property for the repayment of the loan.  (Sec. 215) The Social Security Administration (SSA) is directed to develop a database to facilitate the verification of consumer information upon request by a certified financial institution. Such verification shall be provided only with the consumer's consent and in connection with a credit transaction. Users of the database shall pay system costs as determined by the SSA. (Sec. 216) The bill directs Treasury to report on the risks of cyber threats to financial institutions and capital markets.  (Sec. 217) The bill amends the Federal Reserve Act to lower the maximum allowable amount of surplus funds of the Federal Reserve banks. TITLE III--PROTECTIONS FOR VETERANS, CONSUMERS, AND HOMEOWNERS (Sec. 301) The bill amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to increase the length of time a consumer reporting agency must include a fraud alert in a consumer's file. It also: (1) requires a consumer reporting agency to provide a consumer with free credit freezes and to notify a consumer of their availability, (2) establishes provisions related to the placement and removal of these freezes, (3) creates requirements related to the protection of the credit records of minors.  (Sec. 302) The bill limits, and establishes  a dispute process and verification procedures with respect to, the inclusion of a veteran's medical debt in a consumer credit report.  (Sec. 303) The bill extends immunity from liability to certain individuals employed at financial institutions who, in good faith and with reasonable care, disclose the suspected exploitation of a senior citizen to a regulatory or law-enforcement agency. Similarly, the employing financial institution shall not be liable with respect to disclosures made by such employees.  The bill allows financial institutions and third-party entities to offer training related to the suspected financial exploitation of a senior citizen to specified employees. The bill provides guidance regarding the content, timing, and record-maintenance requirements of such training.  (Sec. 304) The sunset provision of the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act is repealed, restoring notification requirements and other protections related to the eviction of renters in foreclosed properties. (The Act expired on December 31, 2014.) (Sec. 305) Treasury may use loan guarantees and credit enhancements to remediate lead and asbestos hazards in residential properties.  (Sec. 306) The bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to revise the Family-Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, an employment and savings incentive program for families that reside in public housing or have housing vouchers. Specifically, the bill:   combines existing, separately operated FSS programs into a single program;  extends program eligibility to tenants of certain privately owned properties subsidized with project-based rental assistance;  revises program requirements related to eligibility, supportive services, and escrow deposits; and  otherwise modifies the FSS program.  (Sec. 307) The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is directed to promulgate ability-to-repay regulations regarding property assessed clean energy financing. (Sec. 308) The bill directs the GAO to report on the accuracy and security of consumer reporting agencies and consumer reports.  (Sec. 309) A refinanced home loan may not be guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), unless: (1) a specified minimum time period has passed between the original loan and the refinancing; and (2) the lender complies with provisions related to fee recoupment, mortgage interest rates, and net tangible benefit tests. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) must report on the liquidity of the VA Housing Loan Program. The VA must report annually on refinanced home loans to veterans. (Sec. 310) The bill amends the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act to allow the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), when determining whether to purchase a residential mortgage, to consider a borrower's credit score only if certain procedural requirements are met with respect to the validation and approval of credit-scoring models. The Federal Housing Finance Agency must, by regulation, establish standards and criteria for processes used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to validate and approve credit-scoring models in accordance with the bill. (Sec. 311) The GAO is directed to report on foreclosures, homeownership, and mortgage defaults in Puerto Rico before and after Hurricane Maria. (Sec. 312) HUD must report on and provide recommendations for lead-based paint hazard prevention and abatement, with an emphasis on preventing exposure in children. (Sec. 313) The bill amends the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 to make permanent the one-year grace period during which a servicemember is protected from foreclosure after leaving military service.  TITLE IV--TAILORING REGULATIONS FOR CERTAIN BANK HOLDING COMPANIES  (Sec. 401) The bill amends the Financial Stability Act of 2010, with respect to nonbank financial companies supervised by the FRB and certain bank holding companies, to:  increase the asset threshold at which certain enhanced prudential standards shall apply, from $50 billion to $250 billion, while allowing the FRB discretion in determining whether a financial institution with assets equal or greater than $100 billion must be subject to such standards;  increase the asset threshold at which company-run stress tests are required, from $10 billion to $250 billion; and  increase the asset threshold for mandatory risk committees, from $10 billion to $50 billion.  (Sec. 402) The bill requires the appropriate federal banking agencies to exclude, for purposes of calculating a custodial bank's supplementary leverage ratio, funds of a custodial bank that are deposited with a central bank. (""Supplementary leverage ratio"" is a capital adequacy measure that refers to the ratio of a banking organization's tier-one capital to its leverage exposure.) The amount of such funds may not exceed the total value of deposits of the custodial bank linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts.  (Sec. 403) This bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require certain municipal obligations to be treated as level 2B liquid assets if they are investment grade, liquid, and readily marketable. Under current law, corporate debt securities and publicly traded common-equity shares, but not municipal obligations, may be treated as level 2B liquid assets (which are considered to be high-quality assets).  TITLE V--ENCOURAGING CAPITAL FORMATION  (Sec. 501) The bill amends the Securities Act of 1933 to exempt from state registration securities qualified for national trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and authorized to be listed on a national securities exchange. Currently, securities listed on exchanges specified by statute or SEC rule are exempt.  (Sec. 502) The bill directs the SEC to report on the risks and benefits of algorithmic trading in capital markets. (Sec. 504) The bill amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to exempt from the definition of an ""investment company,"" for purposes of specified limitations applicable to such a company under the Act, a qualifying venture capital fund that has no more than 250 investors. Specifically, the bill applies to a venture capital fund that has less than $10 million in aggregate capital contributions and uncalled committed capital. Under current law, a venture capital fund is considered to be an investment company if it has more than 100 investors. (Sec. 505) The bill requires the SEC to offset future fees and assessments due from a national securities exchange or association that: (1) has previously overpaid such fees and assessments, and (2) informs the SEC of the overpayment within 10 years. (Sec. 506) The bill amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to apply the Act to investment companies created under the laws of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or any other U.S. possession. (Sec. 507) The bill requires the SEC to increase, from $5 million to $10 million, the 12-month sales threshold beyond which an issuer is required to provide investors with additional disclosures related to compensatory benefit plans. (Sec. 508) The bill expands the applicability to issuers of ""Regulation A+"" (which exempts certain smaller offerings from securities registration requirements). (Sec. 509) The bill directs the SEC to revise registration rules to allow a closed-end company to use offering and proxy rules currently available to other issuers of securities, thereby reducing filing requirements and restrictions on communications with investors in certain circumstances. (A closed-end company is a publicly traded investment management company that sells a limited number of shares to investors in an initial public offering.) TITLE VI--PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENT BORROWERS (Sec. 601) The bill amends TILA to prospectively revise provisions relating to cosigners of private student loans. Specifically, the bill: (1) prohibits a creditor from declaring a default or accelerating the debt of a private student loan on the sole basis of the death or bankruptcy of a cosigner to such a loan, and (2) directs loan holders to release cosigners from any obligation upon the death of the student borrower.  (Sec. 602) The bill amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to allow a person to request the removal of a previously reported default regarding a private education loan from a consumer report if: (1) the lender chooses to offer a loan-rehabilitation program that requires a number of consecutive on-time monthly payments demonstrating renewed ability and willingness to repay the loan, and (2) the consumer meets those requirements. A consumer may obtain such rehabilitation benefits only once per loan. The GAO shall report on the implementation of these provisions. (Sec. 603) The bill amends the Financial Literacy and Education Improvement Act to direct the Financial Literacy and Education Commission to establish best practices for teaching financial literacy skills at institutions of higher education.","Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act TITLE I--IMPROVING CONSUMER ACCESS TO MORTGAGE CREDIT  (Sec. 101) This bill amends the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to allow a depository institution or credit union with assets below a specified threshold to forgo certain ability-to-pay requirements regarding residential mortgage loans. Specifically, those requirements are waived if a loan: (1) is originated by and retained by the institution, (2) complies with requirements regar...","A bill to promote economic growth, provide tailored regulatory relief, and enhance consumer protections, and for other purposes.",

It directs the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) to award competitive grants to health care, law enforcement, or public safety agencies, and nonprofit organizations, to develop or operate locally based proactive programs to prevent wandering and locate missing individuals with dementia or children with developmental disabilities.

Additionally, it directs the BJA to award grants to health care, law enforcement, or public safety agencies to develop tracking technology programs to locate missing individuals with dementia or children with developmental disabilities.  The bill subjects grants under the Missing Americans Program to accountability provisions. DOJ's Office of Inspector General must conduct annual audits of selected grant recipients.

Deficit-neutral reserve funds generally apply to legislation that: (1) addresses specified policy issues, and (2) does not increase the deficit over a specified time period or periods. The resolution also includes two reserve funds that do not include a requirement regarding the effect on the deficit.)

TITLE IV--BUDGET PROCESS  Subtitle A--Budget Enforcement  (Sec. 4101) Updates the existing point of order against advanced appropriations to conform to the new budget window. (Under the resolution, an advanced appropriation is any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2018 that first becomes available after FY2018, or any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2019 that first becomes available after FY2019. The point of order limits advanced appropriations to specified accounts and prohibits total advanced appropriations from exceeding $28.852 billion in new budget authority in each year).  (Sec. 4102) Extends the point of order restricting the inclusion of certain changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPS) to appropriations legislation for FY2018-FY2020.

(Sec. 4106) Repeals the existing Senate Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) point of order that prohibits the consideration of legislation that would cause or increase an on-budget deficit over specified six- and eleven-year time periods.  Replaces the point of order with a new PAYGO point of order that continues the six-year and eleven-year time periods and adds two additional time periods during which the legislation may not cause or increase an on-budget deficit: (1) the current year, and (2) the budget year.  (Sec. 4107) Directs the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation to provide estimates of the macroeconomic effects of major legislation. (These estimates are frequently referred to as dynamic scoring and include estimates of the budgetary effects from changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables resulting from the legislation.) Requires the estimates, to the extent practicable, to include the distributional effects across income categories resulting from major legislation.  (Sec. 4108) Permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust the committee allocations, aggregates, allocations, levels, and limits contained this resolution if a measure becomes law that amends the discretionary spending limits established under Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to increase the limit for the revised security category for FY2018 to $640 billion. (Sec. 4109) Permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust: (1) discretionary spending limits established under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985; and (2) committee allocations, budgetary aggregates, allocations, and levels included in this resolution for legislation that provides wildfire suppression funding.

(Sec. 4113) Permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to file in the Congressional Record committee allocations enforcing this resolution if the resolution passes both the House and Senate in identical form, a conference committee is not convened, and a joint explanatory statement is not produced.  Subtitle B--Other Provisions  (Sec. 4201) Directs Senate committees to review programs and tax expenditures within their jurisdiction to identify waste, fraud, abuse, or duplication and increase the use of performance data to inform committee work.  (Sec. 4202) Requires the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on the budget resolution to include amounts for the discretionary administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service in the allocations to the appropriations committees.  (Sec. 4203) Sets forth procedures for adjustments of the allocations and aggregates included in the budget resolution.  (Sec. 4204) Permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust levels and allocations in this budget resolution to reflect changes in concepts and definitions.

The summary of that version is repeated here.) Creating High-Quality Results and Outcomes Necessary to Improve Chronic (CHRONIC) Care Act of 2017 TITLE I--RECEIVING HIGH QUALITY CARE IN THE HOME (Sec. 101) This bill extends and expands the Independence at Home demonstration program, through which comprehensive primary care services are delivered at home to Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. (Sec. 102) A Medicare beneficiary who has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is receiving home dialysis may choose to receive monthly ESRD-related visits via telehealth, provided that the beneficiary also receives face-to-face visits periodically. Specified facility fees and geographic requirements shall not apply with respect to the provision of such services via telehealth. TITLE II--ADVANCING TEAM BASED CARE (Sec. 201) Current law allows a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan, until 2019, to restrict plan enrollment to individuals who are within one or more classes of special-needs individuals. The bill allows an MA plan to do so permanently, provided that the plan meets specified applicable requirements.  The Federal Coordinated Health Care Office within the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) shall serve as a dedicated point of contact for states with regard to special-needs MA plans for individuals who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. The CMS shall establish a unified process for grievances and appeals for individuals enrolled in such plans. The CMS must, with respect to special-needs MA plans for individuals with chronic conditions, convene a panel of clinical advisors to establish and update the list of chronic conditions that make an individual eligible for participation in such a plan. The CMS shall, with respect to special-needs MA plans, consider applying certain quality measures at the plan level rather than at the contract level. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must report to Congress on state-level integration between the Medicaid program and special-needs MA plans for individuals who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. TITLE III--EXPANDING INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY (Sec. 301) The Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Innovation shall expand testing of an MA value-based insurance model that allows MA plans to propose and design benefit structures that vary benefits, cost-sharing, and supplemental benefits with respect to enrollees who have specific chronic diseases. The test model (initially being carried out in specified states) shall be expanded to all states, and may not be terminated prior to 2022. (Sec. 302) Beginning in plan year 2020, an MA plan may provide certain supplemental benefits to chronically ill enrollees. The GAO must report to Congress on the provision of such supplemental benefits to MA enrollees. (Sec. 303) Beginning in plan year 2020, an MA plan may provide certain additional telehealth benefits. (Sec. 304) With respect to the provision of telehealth services to Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries at home by certain accountable care organizations (ACOs), the home shall be treated as an originating site. In such a case, (1) specified geographic limitations shall generally not apply, (2) the CMS shall not pay an originating-site facility fee, and (3) the CMS shall not pay for services that are inappropriate to furnish in a home setting. The GAO must report to Congress on the implementation of these requirements. (Sec. 305) Certain siting requirements applicable under the Medicare program shall not apply to telehealth services furnished after 2020 for purposes of evaluating an acute stroke. The CMS shall not, with respect to such telehealth services, pay an originating-site facility fee to an originating site that does not meet those requirements. TITLE IV--IDENTIFYING THE CHRONICALLY ILL POPULATION (Sec. 401) The bill requires the CMS to: (1) allow certain ACOs to elect prospective, rather than retrospective, assignment of Medicare FFS beneficiaries; and (2) allow a Medicare FFS beneficiary to voluntarily identify an ACO professional as the beneficiary's primary care provider for purposes of the beneficiary's assignment to an ACO. TITLE V--EMPOWERING INDIVIDUALS AND CAREGIVERS IN CARE DELIVERY (Sec. 501) The bill allows certain ACOs to operate incentive-payment programs for beneficiaries who receive qualifying primary-care services.  (Sec. 502) The GAO must report to Congress on the establishment, under Medicare, of a payment code for longitudinal comprehensive-care planning services. TITLE VI--OTHER POLICIES TO IMPROVE CARE FOR THE CHRONICALLY ILL (Sec. 601) The CMS must establish a process for Medicare prescription drug plan (PDP) sponsors to request, beginning in plan year 2020, standardized extracts of claims data for Medicare hospital and medical services. PDP sponsors may use such data: (1) to optimize therapeutic outcomes through improved medication use, (2) to improve care coordination so as to prevent adverse health outcomes, or (3) for any other purpose determined appropriate by the CMS. PDP sponsors may not, however, use such data: (1) to inform coverage determinations; (2) to conduct retroactive reviews of medically accepted indications determinations; (3) to direct enrollment changes; (4) to inform marketing of benefits; or (5) for certain other purposes affecting the security of personal health information, as determined by the CMS. (Sec. 602) The GAO must report to Congress on the extent to which Medicare PDPs and private payors use programs that synchronize pharmacy dispensing to facilitate comprehensive counseling and promote medication adherence. (Sec. 603) The GAO must report to Congress on the use of prescription drugs to manage the weight of obese patients and the impact of such drugs on patient health and health care spending. (Sec. 604) The CMS shall report to Congress on long-term cost drivers to the Medicare program that may contribute to the deterioration of health conditions among Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions. TITLE VII--OFFSETS (Sec. 701) The bill eliminates annual funding available to the Medicare Improvement Fund beginning in FY2021.

It revises an existing purpose area to require the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), in disseminating information on juvenile delinquency prevention programs, to promote evidence-based programs and practices.  It also adds, as a new purpose area, support for a continuum of evidence-based or promising programs that are trauma-informed, reflect the science of adolescent development, and are designed to meet the needs of at-risk youth who come into contact with the juvenile justice system.  TITLE II--JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION (Sec. 201) The bill requires the OJJDP, in developing objectives, priorities, strategies, and long-term plans, to take into account scientific knowledge regarding: (1) adolescent development and behavior, and (2) the effects of delinquency prevention programs and juvenile justice interventions on adolescents. The OJJDP, in consultation with Indian tribes, must develop a policy to collaborate with representatives of Indian tribes with a criminal justice function to implement the provisions of this bill relating to Indian tribes. (Sec. 202) It expands membership on the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (Coordinating Council) to include the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Secretary of the Interior. (Sec. 203) This section modifies requirements for the OJJDP's annual report on juveniles in custody. Specifically, it adds ethnicity to the list of offender characteristics and expands the categories of information that must be summarized and analyzed. It adds requirements for the annual report to describe criteria used to determine what programs qualify as evidence-based and promising programs and funding provided to Indian tribes; and to analyze and evaluate the OJJDP's internal controls and the total amount of payments recouped from grantees that violate the OJJDP's policies and procedures. (Sec. 204) It increases from 2% to 5% the maximum amount of Formula Grant funds that may be used to provide technical assistance to states in complying with the core requirements and implementing a juvenile justice and delinquency plan. It increases each state's minimum allocation under the population-based Formula Grant program from $325,000 to $400,000 if the title II appropriation is less than $75 million in a fiscal year. A state's relative population of individuals under 18 years of age must be based on the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data. The 10% maximum amount of a state's Formula Grant allocation that can be used for planning and administration includes designation of at least one individual to coordinate and certify compliance with the core requirements. (Sec. 205) This section modifies the required components of a state's juvenile justice and delinquency plan. A state's annual update to the three-year plan must describe how the plan is supported by and takes account of scientific knowledge regarding adolescent development and behavior and regarding the effects of prevention programs and juvenile justice interventions. A state must post its plan or amended plan on a publicly accessible website. The bill modifies State Advisory Group membership qualifications to include representatives of public agencies that prevent or treat mental health, substance abuse, or disabilities in adolescents; volunteers who work as court-appointed legal counsel for juveniles; and individuals who represent victim or witness advocacy groups. It also increases from 24 years to 28 years the maximum age of youth members at the time of appointment. It eliminates the requirement for an eligible Indian tribe to perform law enforcement functions. A state's juvenile justice and delinquency plan must contain additional components, including plans to: provide alternatives to detention, reduce children in secure detention and corrections facilities, engage family members, use community-based services, promote evidence-based and trauma-informed programs and practices, and limit the use of restraints on pregnant juvenile offenders. The bill modifies program areas under the Formula Grant program. It revises existing program areas to specify that: (1) educational programs and support services include projects to prevent and reduce truancy; and (2) the scope of juveniles served by mentoring, counseling, and training programs includes juveniles whose parent or guardian is incarcerated in a tribal facility. It adds new program areas to expand access to legal counsel, to inform juveniles of the opportunity and process for expunging juvenile records, to address the needs of at-risk girls, and to monitor compliance and provide technical assistance with the core requirements. The bill prioritizes funding for entities that meet the criteria for evidence-based or promising programs. The bill modifies the core requirements with which a state must comply to receive a full allocation of funds under the Formula Grant program. First, it revises the deinstitutionalization of status offenders core requirement, which prohibits the secure detention or confinement of a juvenile who commits a status offense (i.e., an offense that would not be a crime if committed by an adult). Specifically, use of the valid court order exception to securely detain or confine a juvenile status offender must comply with additional requirements, such as issuance of a court order and a seven-day maximum length of detention.  Second, it modifies the separation and jail removal core requirements to specify that sight or sound contact is the level of contact prohibited between juveniles and adults. Sight or sound contact means any physical, clear visual, or verbal contact that is not brief or inadvertent. Third, it revises the disproportionate minority contact requirement to require a state to implement policy, practice, and system improvement strategies to identify and reduce racial and ethnic disparities among youth who come into contact with the juvenile justice system. It retains the prohibition against using numerical standards or quotas. A state must provide for an effective (previously, adequate) system of monitoring compliance with the core requirements. The OJJDP must annually conduct, and publish the results of, a compliance determination for each state that participates in the Formula Grant program. (Sec. 206) Formula Grant program funds that are unallocated due to the failure of states to comply with core requirements must be reallocated equally among compliant states and the OJJDP. (Sec. 207) The bill modifies certain purpose areas of the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant program to specify that: (1) the scope of juveniles served by comprehensive juvenile justice and delinquency prevention projects includes juveniles with disabilities, (2) educational projects to prevent juvenile delinquency include projects to prevent and reduce truancy and to develop social and independent living skills, and (3) the scope of juveniles served by treatment projects and community-based projects and services includes status offenders.  (Sec. 208) It increases from 5% to 10% the maximum amount of a Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant that a state may use for administration, evaluation, and technical assistance.  (Sec. 209) It eliminates the requirement for an eligible Indian tribe to provide, in an application for a Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant allocation, evidence that it performs law enforcement functions.  (Sec. 210) This section requires (currently, authorizes) the OJJDP to annually publish a plan to identify (currently, plan and identify) the purposes and goals of funded initiatives to research and evaluate juvenile justice matters. It revises and expands the list of juvenile justice matters initiatives. The OJJDP must study the coordination of services and treatment between the juvenile justice and child welfare systems. It must describe best practices in discharge planning and assess post-confinement living arrangements of juveniles who cannot return home. This bill directs (currently, authorizes) the OJJDP to analyze juvenile justice statistics. The OJJDP must, with respect to juvenile recidivism data, establish a uniform collection method, establish a common measurement system, and publish cumulative data collected by states. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must review available research conducted by federal agencies and entities related to Indian youth who come into contact with the juvenile justice system. (Sec. 211) It requires (currently, permits) the OJJDP to provide training, technical assistance, and information dissemination. It adds requirements for the OJJDP to provide: training to states to implement the JJDPA's core requirements, current protocols and best practices for achieving monitoring compliance, and information sharing regarding evidence-based and promising programs or practices. It adds requirements for the OJJDP to provide technical assistance to state and local governments to comply with amendments to the core requirements and state plans; and to improve recruitment, selection, training, and retention of juvenile justice professionals. Finally, the OJJDP must develop standards of practice for attorneys representing children; coordinate training and technical assistance programs for local and state juvenile detention and corrections personnel; provide training and technical assistance with respect to appropriate services and placement for youth with mental health or substance abuse needs; and make grants for juvenile court judges and judicial personnel. (Sec. 212) The OJJDP must, in developing guidance and procedures, consult state and local governments. TITLE III--INCENTIVE GRANTS FOR LOCAL DELINQUENCY PREVENTION PROGRAMS (Sec. 301) This section adds a definition for the term ""mentoring."" (Sec. 302) It broadens the authorized grant purposes under the Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Programs to include evidence-based or promising programs on mentoring, parent training and support, or in-home family services. TITLE IV--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS (Sec. 401) The GAO must evaluate the OJJDP's performance and audit selected grant recipients. (Sec. 402) The bill amends the JJDPA to add a new title:  that reauthorizes through FY2021 programs under the JJDPA;  that expresses the sense of Congress that the OJJDP must restore meaningful enforcement of, and states must ensure full compliance with, the core requirements; that subjects juvenile justice grants to accountability provisions; and  that requires DOJ to identify and report on duplicative grant awards.  TITLE V--JUVENILE ACCOUNTABILITY BLOCK GRANTS (Sec. 501) This section amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to condition a state's receipt of funds under the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program on compliance with the core requirements of the JJDPA applicable to the detention and confinement of juveniles.

The expanded summary of the Senate passed version is repeated here.) National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017 TITLE I--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS (Sec. 101) This bill authorizes appropriations to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for FY2017 for:    exploration;   space operations;   science;   aeronautics;   space technology;   education;   safety, security, and mission services;   construction and environmental compliance and restoration; and   the NASA Inspector General.  TITLE II--SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE COMMITMENTS (Sec. 201) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that NASA should be a multi-mission space agency and should have a balanced and robust set of core missions in space science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight and exploration, and education.  TITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT (Sec. 301) The bill states that the primary objectives of the International Space Station (ISS) program shall be to:  achieve the long-term goal and objectives for human space flight and exploration as specified in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010, and  pursue a research program that advances knowledge and provides other benefits to the nation.    The bill restates that it shall be U.S. policy, in consultation with its international partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.  In furthering such policy, NASA shall:  pursue international, commercial, and intragovernmental means to maximize ISS logistics supply, maintenance, and operational capabilities, reduce risks to ISS systems sustainability, and offset and minimize U.S. operations costs relating to the ISS; utilize the ISS for the development of capabilities and technologies needed for the future of human space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and  utilize the ISS for Science Mission Directorate missions in low-Earth orbit.   (Sec. 302) It is the sense of Congress that:   NASA should build upon the success of the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services and Commercial Resupply Services programs that have allowed private sector companies to partner with NASA to deliver cargo and scientific experiments to the ISS since 2012, and  the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should be continued so as to leverage state and private investments to achieve such program's goals.   Congress reaffirms:  its commitment to the use of a commercially developed, private sector launch and delivery system to the ISS for crew missions; and  the requirement that NASA shall make use of U.S. commercially provided ISS crew transfer and crew rescue services.   The federal government may not acquire human space flight transportation services from a foreign entity unless:  there is no U.S. government-operated human space flight capability available, there is no U.S. commercial provider available, and  it is a qualified foreign entity.   The bill declares that nothing in this section shall prevent NASA from negotiating or entering into human space flight transportation arrangements with foreign entities to ensure safety of flight and continued ISS operations.  The bill states that the objective of the Commercial Crew Program shall be to assist in the development and certification of commercially provided transportation that can: (1) carry U.S. government astronauts safely, reliably, and affordably to and from the ISS; (2) serve as a crew rescue vehicle; and (3) accomplish those goals as soon as practicable. Such objective shall be the primary consideration in the acquisition strategy for such program.  NASA shall protect the safety of government astronauts by ensuring that each commercially provided transportation system under the Commercial Crew Program meets all applicable human rating requirements under specified federal law.  Consistent with the findings and recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, NASA shall ensure that safety and the minimization of the probability of loss of crew are the critical priorities of such program.  NASA shall strive through the competitive selection process to minimize the life cycle cost to NASA through the planned period of commercially provided crew transportation services. The Commercial Orbital Transportation Services Program is renamed the Commercial Resupply Services Program.  The bill declares that it is U.S. policy that, in order to foster the competitive development, operation, improvement, and commercial availability of space transportation services, and to minimize the life cycle cost to NASA, NASA shall procure services for federal government access to and return from the ISS by fair and open competition for well-defined, milestone-based, Federal Acquisition Regulation-based contracts.  NASA shall, in a manner that does not add costs or schedule delays to the Commercial Crew and Commercial Resupply Services programs, ensure that all providers of such programs furnish evidence-based support for their costs and schedules. NASA shall submit to Congress a report:  identifying the lessons learned to date from previous and existing Commercial Resupply Services contracts, indicating whether changes are needed as to the manner in which NASA procures and manages similar services prior to the issuance of future Commercial Resupply Services procurement opportunities, and  identifying any lessons learned from the Commercial Resupply Services contracts that should be applied to the procurement and management of commercially provided crew transfer services to and from the ISS or to other future procurements.  (Sec. 303) NASA shall develop a plan for transitioning the ISS from the current regime that relies heavily on NASA sponsorship to a regime where NASA could be one of many customers of a low-Earth orbit non-governmental human space flight enterprise. NASA shall submit biennial reports until 2023 which include:   a description of the progress NASA is making in achieving its deep space human exploration objectives on the ISS and prospects for accomplishing future mission requirements, space exploration objectives, and other research objectives on future commercially supplied low-Earth orbit platforms or migration of those objectives to cis-lunar space; steps NASA is taking and will take, including demonstrations that could be conducted on the ISS, to stimulate and facilitate commercial demand and supply of products and services in low-Earth orbit;  identification of barriers preventing the commercialization of low-Earth orbit; the cost estimates for extending operations of the ISS to 2024, 2028, and 2030; evaluation of the feasible and preferred service life of the ISS beyond September 30, 2024, through at least 2028, as a unique scientific, commercial, and exploration-related facility; and the impact on deep space exploration capabilities, including a crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s, if the preferred service life of the ISS is extended beyond 2024 and NASA maintains a flat budget profile.   The bill defines ""cis-lunar space"" as the region of space from the Earth out to and including the region around the surface of the Moon.  If additional government crew, power, and transportation resources are available after meeting NASA's requirements for ISS activities as defined in the Human Exploration Roadmap to be developed pursuant to section 432 of this bill and related research, demonstrations identified in the biennial reports may:  test the capabilities needed to meet future mission requirements, space exploration objectives, and other research objectives described in such reports; and  demonstrate or test capabilities, including those for commercial modules or deep space habitats, Environmental Control and Life Support Systems, orbital satellite assembly, and exploration space suits.  (Sec. 304) NASA shall develop a plan for meeting NASA's projected space communication and navigation needs for low-Earth orbit and deep space operations in the 20-year period following enactment of this bill.  Such plan shall include:  the lifecycle cost estimates and a 5-year funding profile, the performance capabilities required to meet NASA's projected space communication and navigation needs, an identification of the projected space communications and navigation network and infrastructure needs, an identification of the projected Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System needs in the 20-year period following this bill's enactment, and the measures NASA is taking to mitigate threats to electromagnetic spectrum use.    (Sec. 305) Any contract between NASA and a provider (a person that provides domestic launch or domestic reentry services to the federal government) may provide that the United States will indemnify that provider against successful claims (including reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) by third parties for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property resulting from launch services and reentry services carried out under the contract that are defined in it as unusually hazardous or nuclear in nature, but only to the extent the total amount of successful claims related to the activities under that contract:  is more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, and  is not more than $1.5 billion (plus additional amounts necessary to reflect inflation occurring after January 1, 1989) above such insurance or financial responsibility amount.   A contract made under this section that provides indemnification shall provide for:  notice to the United States of any claim or suit against the provider for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property; and  control of or assistance in the defense by the United States, at its election, of such claim or suit and approval of any settlement.   A provider that has a contract with NASA under this section shall obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility in amounts to compensate for the maximum probable loss from claims by:  a third party for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from a launch service or reentry service carried out under the contract; and  the federal government for damage or loss to government property resulting from a launch service or reentry service carried out under such contract.   NASA shall determine maximum probable losses within 90 days of the provider requesting such a determination and submitting all of the information that NASA requires. NASA may revise such a determination based on new information.  For the total claims related to one launch or reentry, a provider shall not be required to obtain insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility of more than:  $500 million with respect to a third party, or $100 million with respect to the federal government; or  the maximum liability insurance available on the world market at reasonable cost.   An insurance policy or demonstration of financial responsibility regarding this section shall protect to the extent of their potential liability for involvement in launch services or reentry services the federal government, its personnel and related entities, related entities of the provider, and government astronauts. NASA may not indemnify a provider under this section until there is a cross-waiver between NASA and the provider. The bill states that NASA shall reciprocally waive claims with a provider under which each party agrees to be responsible and agrees to ensure that its related entities are responsible for damage or loss to its property, or for losses resulting from any injury or death sustained by its employees or agents. Such a waiver shall apply only to the extent that the claims are more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility. Indemnification under this section may exclude claims that result from the willfull misconduct of the provider or its related entities.  No payment may be made under this section unless NASA or its designee certifies that the amount is just and reasonable. NASA may not provide indemnification under this section for an activity requiring a license or permit under provisions relating to commercial space launch activities.  TITLE IV--ADVANCING HUMAN DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION Subtitle A--Human Space Flight and Exploration Goals and Objectives (Sec. 411) The bill states that the long-terms goals for the human space flight and exploration efforts of NASA shall be:  to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit, and to do so where practical, with the involvement of international, academic, and industry partners ,  crewed missions and progress toward achieving the expansion of human presence beyond low-Earth orbit to enable the potential for subsequent human exploration and the extension of human presence throughout the solar system, and  to enable a capability to extend human presence, including potential human habitation on another celestial body and a thriving space economy in the 21st Century.  (Sec. 412) The key U.S. objectives for human expansion into space shall include achieving human exploration of Mars and beyond through the prioritization of those technologies and capabilities best suited for such a mission in accordance with the stepping stone approach to exploration specified in federal law.   (Sec. 413) NASA shall manage human space flight programs, including the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion multipurpose crew vehicle, to enable humans to explore Mars and other space destinations.  (Sec. 414) NASA: (1) may conduct missions to intermediate destinations in order to achieve the objective of human exploration of Mars, and (2) shall incorporate any such missions into the human exploration roadmap.   The bill declares that in order to maximize the cost-effectiveness of the long-term exploration and utilization activities of the United States, NASA shall take all necessary steps, including engaging international, academic, and industry partners, to ensure that activities in NASA's human exploration program balance how those activities might also help meet the requirements of future exploration and utilization activities leading to human habitation on the surface of Mars. Within budgetary considerations, once an exploration-related project enters its development phase, NASA shall seek to complete such project without any undue delays. Furthermore, in order to achieve the goal of successfully conducting a crewed mission to the surface of Mars, the President may invite U.S. partners in the ISS program and other nations, as appropriate, to participate in an international initiative under the leadership of the United States.  (Sec. 415) NASA shall implement an exploration research and technology development program for enabling human and robotic operations.  (Sec. 417) The bill declares that in order to ensure continuous U.S. participation and leadership in the exploration and use of space and as an essential instrument of national security, it is U.S. policy to maintain uninterrupted capability for human space flight and operations:   in low-Earth orbit; and  beyond low-Earth orbit once the capabilities described in section 421 of this bill become available.   NASA shall submit annual reports to Congress which describe the progress being made toward the development of the SLS and Orion.  Subtitle B--Assuring Core Capabilities for Exploration (Sec. 421) Congress reaffirms the policy and minimum capability requirements for the SLS.  NASA should budget for and undertake a ground test and uncrewed and crewed flight test and demonstration program for the SLS and Orion in order to promote safety and reduce programmatic risk. NASA shall continue the development of the fully integrated SLS, including an upper stage needed to go beyond low-Earth orbit, in order to safely enable human space exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond over the course of the next century.  Within 60 days of enactment of this bill, NASA shall submit to Congress a report that addresses the ability of Orion to meet the requirement specified in federal law that it be designed to have, at a minimum, the capability to provide an alternative means of delivery of crew and cargo to the ISS in the event that other vehicles, whether commercial vehicles or partner-supplied vehicles, are unable to perform that function. Such report shall detail:  those components and systems of Orion which ensure that it is in compliance with such minimum capability requirement; the expected date that Orion, integrated with a vehicle other than the SLS, could be available to transport crew and cargo to the ISS; any impacts to the deep space exploration missions NASA shall continue development of pursuant to this section which are due to enabling Orion in meeting such minimum capability requirement and conducting such a mission to the ISS; and the overall cost and schedule impacts associated with enabling Orion in meeting such requirement and conducting such a mission.   NASA shall also continue the development of:   an uncrewed exploration mission to demonstrate the capability of the SLS and Orion as an integrated system by 2018;  a crewed exploration mission to demonstrate the SLS, including the core stage and exploration upper stages by 2021;  subsequent missions beginning with the EM-3 at operational flight rate sufficient to maintain safety and operational readiness using the SLS and Orion to extend into cis-lunar space and eventually to Mars; and  a deep space habitat as a key element in a deep space exploration architecture along with the SLS and Orion.   NASA shall assess the utility of the SLS for use by the science community and for other federal government launch needs, including considering the overall cost and schedule savings from reduced transit times and increased science returns enabled by the capabilities of the SLS.  NASA, in consultation with the Department of Defense and the Office of National Intelligence, shall prepare a report that addresses the effort and budget required to enable and utilize a cargo variant of the 130-ton SLS configuration specified in federal law.  In preparing such report NASA shall:  consider the technical requirements of the scientific and national security communities related to a cargo variant of the SLS; and  assess the utility and estimated cost savings obtained by using such a cargo variant for national security and space science missions.   Subtitle C--Journey to Mars (Sec. 432) NASA shall develop a human exploration roadmap, including a critical decision plan, for expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit to the surface of Mars and beyond, considering potential interim destinations such as cis-lunar space and the moons of Mars. The human exploration roadmap shall include:  an integrated set of exploration, science, and other goals and objectives of a U.S. human space exploration program with the long-term goal of human missions near or on the surface of Mars in the 2030s; sets and sequences of precursor missions in cis-lunar space and other missions or activities necessary to demonstrate the proficiency of the specific capabilities and technologies identified in the roadmap and to meet the goals and objectives developed under the human space exploration program, including anticipated timelines and missions for the SLS and Orion;  an identification of the specific capabilities and technologies, including the SLS, Orion, a deep space habitat, and other capabilities, that facilitate the goals and objectives developed under such program; and a description of how cis-lunar elements, objectives, and activities advance the human exploration of Mars.   As part of the human exploration roadmap, NASA shall include a critical decision plan that:  identifies and defines key decisions to guide human space exploration priorities and plans that need to be made by June 30, 2020; define decisions needed to maximize efficiencies and resources for reaching the near, intermediate, and long-term goals and objectives of human space exploration; and  identifies and defines timelines and milestones for a sustainable cadence of missions beginning with EM-3 for the SLS and Orion to extend human exploration from cis-lunar space to the surface of Mars.   NASA shall submit an initial human exploration roadmap, including a critical decision plan, by December 1, 2017, and updated roadmaps at least biennially.   (Sec. 433) NASA shall submit a plan for achieving an advanced space suit capability that aligns with crew needs for exploration enabled by the SLS and Orion, including an evaluation of the merit of delivering the planned suit system for use on the ISS.  (Sec. 434) NASA shall evaluate:   those alternative approaches to the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission that demonstrate the technologies and capabilities needed for a human mission to Mars; the scientific and technical benefits of those approaches; and the commercial benefits of those approaches, including their impact on the development of domestic solar electric propulsion technology to bolster U.S. competitiveness in the global marketplace.   (Sec. 435) NASA shall contract with an independent, non-governmental systems engineering and technical assistance organization to study the feasibility of the launch of a human space flight mission to Mars in 2033.

Subtitle B--Supply Star  (Sec. 211) A Supply Star program is established within DOE to identify and promote practices, recognize companies, and recognize products that use highly efficient supply chains that conserve energy, water, and other resources. DOE may award grants or other incentives for studying supply chain energy resource efficiency and demonstrating and achieving reductions in the energy resource consumption of commercial products. Subtitle C--Extended Product System Rebate Program  (Sec. 221) DOE must establish a rebate program for expenditures for purchasing and installing a new constant speed electric motor control that reduces energy use by at least 5%.  Subtitle D--Transformer Rebate Program  (Sec. 231) DOE must establish a rebate program for expenditures made by qualified industrial or manufacturing facilities, commercial buildings, and multifamily residential buildings for the purchase and installation of certain energy efficient transformers. This program terminates on December 31, 2019. TITLE III--FEDERAL AGENCY ENERGY EFFICIENCY  (Sec. 301) The bill amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to require each federal agency to collaborate with the Office of the Management and Budget (OMB) to develop an implementation strategy for the maintenance, purchase, and use of energy-efficient and energy-saving information technologies.   OMB must establish performance goals for evaluating the efforts of agencies in improving such information technology systems.  (Sec. 302) The bill amends the EISA to revise requirements for the voluntary national information program. DOE must: (1) maintain a data center energy practitioner program for certifying energy practitioners qualified to evaluate the energy usage and efficiency opportunities in federal data centers, (2) establish an open data initiative for federal data center energy usage data, (3) participate in efforts to harmonize global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency, and (4) facilitate in the development of an efficiency metric that measures the energy efficiency of a data center. (Sec. 303) The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) must establish a program that demonstrates the use of budget-neutral, performance-based agreements for energy or water conservation improvements at multifamily residential units. This program terminates on September 30, 2020. TITLE IV--REGULATORY PROVISIONS  Subtitle A--Third-Party Certification Under Energy Star Program (Sec. 401) The bill amends the EPCA to require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revise the certification requirements for the labeling of consumer, home, and office electronic products for program partners that have complied with all requirements of the Energy Star program for a period of at least 18 months. Those requirements may not require third-party certification for a product to be listed. Subtitle B--Federal Green Buildings  (Sec. 411) The bill amends the EISA by directing the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings of the General Services Administration to identify and provide to DOE a list of private sector green building certification systems that are most likely to encourage a comprehensive and environmentally sound approach to certification of green buildings. Subtitle C--Energy Performance Requirement for Federal Buildings (Sec. 421) The bill amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to extend energy efficiency performance targets for federal buildings through FY2017 (from a 33% reduction from 2003 energy consumption level for FY2016 to a 36% reduction for FY2017). Federal buildings where energy intensive activities are carried out may be excluded from those targets. The bill establishes requirements for excluded buildings.  (Sec. 422) The bill amends the ECPA to expand the scope of existing energy standards for new federal buildings to cover buildings altered by federal agencies and major renovations. DOE must establish federal building energy efficiency performance standards that require federal buildings to meet or exceed applicable state and local building energy codes if the state or local codes are more stringent than the ASHRAE Standard 90.1 or the International Energy Conservation Code.

The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.) Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act Amendments of 2017 TITLE I--INDIAN TRIBAL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND SELF-DETERMINATION ACT AMENDMENTS  (Sec. 101) This bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to direct the Department of the Interior to provide Indian tribes with technical assistance in planning their energy resource development programs.   The Department of Energy (DOE) Indian energy education planning and management assistance program is expanded to make intertribal organizations eligible for grants and to allow grants to be used to increase the capacity of tribes to manage energy development and energy efficiency programs. Eligibility for DOE energy development loan guarantees is expanded to include tribal energy development organizations.  (Sec. 103) This bill allows leases and business agreements that pool, unitize, or communitize a tribe's energy resources with other energy resources.  An energy-related tribal lease, business agreement, or right-of-way does not require Interior's approval if it complies with a tribal energy resource agreement or it is a lease with a tribal energy development organization that Interior has certified, and the term does not exceed specified limits. The process and conditions for Interior's approval of tribal energy resource agreements are revised. This bill revises the process for determining whether an interested party has a valid claim to be suffering an adverse environmental impact due to a tribe's noncompliance with such an agreement. Interior must make available to a tribe the amount Interior would have expended to carry out an activity that the tribe is carrying out pursuant to a tribal energy resource agreement.  (Sec. 104) DOE must collaborate with the Directors of the National Laboratories in making the full array of DOE technical and scientific resources available for tribal energy activities and projects. TITLE II--MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS  (Sec. 201) This bill amends the Federal Power Act to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to give tribes, in addition to states and municipalities, preference for the receipt of preliminary hydroelectric licenses. (Sec. 202) This bill amends the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 to direct Interior, for land under Bureau of Land Management jurisdiction, and the Department of Agriculture (USDA), for land under Forest Service jurisdiction, to enter into agreements with tribes to carry out demonstration projects to promote biomass energy production on Indian forest land and in nearby communities by providing them with reliable supplies of woody biomass from federal lands. Interior and USDA must enter into agreements with tribal organizations to carry out additional biomass demonstration projects.  (Sec. 203) This bill amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to revise requirements for direct home weatherization grants to tribes.   (Sec. 204) Interior, an affected tribe, or a certified third-party appraiser under contract with the tribe must appraise mineral or energy resources involved in a transaction requiring Interior's approval. (Sec. 205) This bill amends the Long-Term Leasing Act to allow the Navajo Nation to enter into mineral resource leases on their restricted lands without Interior's approval. The maximum term of a Navajo Nation lease that does not require Interior's approval is extended for commercial and agricultural leases.  (Sec. 206) The Crow Tribe of Montana may enter into leases of their land held in trust for a term of up to 99 years. (Sec. 207) This bill sets forth provisions for money held by Interior in connection with the review and approval of a sale, lease, permit, or other conveyance of Indian land.",(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced.

These contracts allow federal agencies to work with private contractors on energy efficiency upgrades to federal facilities, unless the facilities are dams, reservoirs, or hydropower facilities owned or operated by federal agencies. Current law requires federal facility energy managers to evaluate and identify energy and water efficiency measures for federal facilities, but agencies are not required to implement the measures. The bill requires agencies to implement the measures if they are cost-effective. The Department of Energy must report to the President and Congress on each agency's performance contracts, including their investment value and their energy savings. The energy conservation measures that may be contained in performance contracts are expanded by including those involving energy consuming devices and required support structures. Agencies may not limit recognition of operation and maintenance savings associated with energy systems that were modernized or replaced with energy conservation measures and water conservation measures (e.g., lower energy and water bills due to energy efficiency and conservation measures). Agencies may sell or transfer energy savings and apply the proceeds to fund a performance contract.  The energy savings that may be contained in performance contracts are expanded to include: (1) the use, sale, or transfer of energy incentives, rebates, or credits (including renewable energy credits) from governments or utilities; and (2) any revenue generated from a reduction in energy or water use, more efficient waste recycling, or additional energy generated from more efficient equipment.

The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Commercial Vessel Incidental Discharge Act This bill requires the U.S. Coast Guard to address the regulation of discharges incidental to the normal operation of a commercial vessel into navigable waters, including ballast water discharges and aquatic nuisance species contained in the discharges. (Sec. 2) An aquatic nuisance species means a nonindigenous species (including a pathogen) that threatens the diversity or abundance of native species or the ecological stability of navigable waters of the United States, or commercial, agricultural, aquacultural, or recreational activities dependent on those waters. Ballast water is water and suspended matter taken on board a commercial vessel to control or maintain trim, draught, stability, or stresses of the commercial vessel, regardless of how it is carried. (Sec. 3) Any regulation issued pursuant to the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 that is in effect before this bill's enactment must remain in effect until it is superseded by a new regulation issued under this bill. The bill applies the sanctions under that Act relating to violations of a regulation issued under this bill. (Sec. 4) Commercial vessels must meet ballast water discharge standards established by the Coast Guard by applying the best available technology that is economically achievable, unless they are a type of vessel exempted from the standards. Additional requirements are established for commercial vessels that enter the Great Lakes through the Saint Lawrence River after operating outside the exclusive economic zone of the United States or Canada. The bill establishes safety exemptions from the discharge requirements. Specifically, commercial vessels may discharge ballast water into navigable waters of the United States if:   the ballast water is discharged solely to ensure the safety of life at sea;  accidentally as the result of damage to the commercial vessel or its equipment and all reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the discharge have been taken, and the owner or operator did not willfully or recklessly cause such damage; or   solely for avoiding or minimizing a discharge from the vessel of a pollutant that would violate an applicable federal or State law.  The Coast Guard may not require the installation of a ballast water management system on a commercial vessel that: (1) carries all of its ballast water in sealed tanks that are not subject to discharge, or (2) discharges ballast water solely into a reception facility that meets certain standards. The Coast Guard must publish a draft policy letter for describing type approval testing methods capable of measuring the concentration of organisms in ballast water that are capable of reproduction. (Sec. 5) By 2022, the Coast Guard, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), must complete an effectiveness review to determine whether revising ballast water discharge standards will result in reducing the risk of introducing or establishing aquatic nuisance species. Further revisions to the standards must be considered every 10 years. States may petition the Coast Guard to conduct an effectiveness review if there is significant new information that could reasonably indicate the ballast water discharge standard could be revised to result in a reduction in the risk of the introduction or establishment of aquatic nuisance species. However, states may not submit a petition during the year following the completion of an effectiveness review. If the standard would result in reducing the risk of introducing or establishing aquatic nuisance species, then the Coast Guard must conduct a practicability review, in consultation with the EPA, to determine whether: (1) a ballast water management system that is capable of achieving the proposed standard is economically achievable and operationally practicable, and (2) testing protocols can accurately measure compliance. The Coast Guard must revise the standard if it meets practicability criteria. The Coast Guard must establish a process for an owner or operator to request an extension of a compliance deadline. The bill deems an extension request to be approved if the Coast Guard does not approve or deny an extension request within 90 days. The bill considers a commercial vessel to be in compliance with the standard if: (1) the ballast water management system installed on the vessel complies with the standard in effect at the time of installation, notwithstanding any revisions to the ballast water discharge standard occurring after the installation; (2) the system is maintained in proper working condition; and (3) the system continues to meet the standard applicable to the vessel at the time of installation. A vessel will no longer be deemed to be in compliance with the standard after: (1) the expiration of the service life of the vessel's ballast water management system, (2) the expiration of the service life of the vessel, or (3) the completion of a major conversion of the vessel. (Sec. 6) The Coast Guard, in consultation with the EPA, may issue a rule establishing alternative compliance programs for a commercial vessel that: (1) has a maximum ballast water capacity of less than eight cubic meters, or (2) is less than three years from the end of the vessel's service life. (Sec. 7) The EPA, in consultation with the Coast Guard, must also issue a rule establishing reasonable and practicable standards for reception facilities to mitigate adverse effects of aquatic nuisance species on navigable waters. Commercial vessels may discharge ballast water into an onshore or offshore facility for the reception of ballast water that meets those standards. (Sec. 8) The Coast Guard, in consultation with the EPA, must establish best management practices for discharges incidental to the normal operation of a commercial vessel for commercial vessels that are at least 79 feet in length and are not fishing vessels. Any practice, limitation, or concentration applicable to any discharge incidental to the normal operation of a commercial vessel that is required by the existing General Permit (the 2013 Final National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Vessel General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of a Vessel issued under the Clean Water Act) must remain in effect until the best management practices are established. If a vessel is under 79 feet or a fishing vessel, it is exempted from requirements for discharges incidental to the normal operation of a commercial vessel, the best management practices, and the requirements under the general permit.  (Sec. 9) The bill allows the filing of a petition for review of a final rule issued under this bill in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The petition must be filed not later than 120 days after the date on which the rule to be reviewed is published in the Federal Register. (Sec. 10) The Coast Guard may enter into an agreement with a state to authorize the state to enforce the bill. (Sec. 11) The bill preempts applicable state laws, unless the state has an enforcement agreement with the Coast Guard. However, states may regulate water or other substance discharged or emitted from a vessel in preparation for transport of the vessel by land from one body of water to another body of water. (Sec. 12) The bill does not affect federal authorities under specified Acts relating to pollution from ships or any anti-fouling system covered under a specified International Convention.  Actions taken under the bill must be in accordance with international law.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced.

(Sec. 4) The bill directs USDA to convey to the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority 7 parcels of federal land if the Trust Authority offers to convey, in two specified phases, 20 parcels of certain nonfederal land.  The conveyances of the federal and nonfederal lands shall be subject to valid existing rights, reservations, rights-of-way, or other encumbrances of third parties in, to, or on such lands.   USDA and the Trust Authority shall exchange, at no cost, reciprocal easements on existing roads that are necessary to access the parcels of land that each party acquires in the land exchange. The exchanged easements must also provide for public access.  USDA and the Trust Authority may enter into a separate cost-share agreement to cover the cost of road maintenance with respect to the easements exchanged.  In conveying the K-3 parcel of the nonfederal land, the Trust Authority shall grant to the United States a 300-foot conservation easement abutting such parcel along its interface and the landfill of the city of Ketchikan. Such easement must provide that the land covered by it remains undeveloped and in the ownership of the Trust Authority. The value of such easement must also be included in the value of the nonfederal land for the purpose of equalizing the values of both the federal and nonfederal lands.  In order to allow time for the completion of ongoing research activities of the Forest Service, USDA shall reserve research easements on certain parcels for: (1) the Sarkar research easement study plot for a 10-year period; (2) the Naukati commercial thinning study plot for a 15-year period; (3) the Prince of Wales (POW) Yatuk study plot for a 10-year period; (4) the POW Naukati study plot for a 10-year period; and (5) the Revilla George study plot for a 10-year period.  The bill prohibits the Trust Authority from constructing new roads or harvesting timber on any study plot covered by an easement during the applicable periods.  In conveying the Naukati Phase 1 and East Naukati/2016 Naukati Addition parcels of the federal land to the Trust Authority, USDA shall reserve to the United States a conservation easement that shall protect the aquatic and riparian habitat within a specified area. Such easement shall prohibit within that area: (1) new road construction and timber harvesting within 100 feet of anadromous water bodies (including underground water bodies); and (2) commercial mineral extraction.  Before completing each phase of the land exchange, USDA shall complete, for the land to be conveyed in the applicable phase, any necessary land surveys and required pre-exchange clearances, reviews, mitigation activities, and approvals related to:  threatened and endangered species, cultural and historic resources, wetland and floodplains, and  hazardous materials.   USDA and the Trust Authority shall select an appraiser to conduct appraisals of the federal and nonfederal lands in accordance with nationally recognized standards.  During a three-year period beginning when the final appraised values of the federal and nonfederal land for each phase of the land exchange are approved by USDA, USDA shall not be required to reappraise or update those values.  The bill states that after the date on which an agreement to exchange the federal and nonfederal lands is entered into under this bill, no reappraisal or updates to the final appraised values approved for such lands by USDA shall be required.  Before completing each phase of land exchange, USDA shall make summaries of the appraisals of the federal and nonfederal lands for that phase available for public review.  The values of the federal and nonfederal lands to be exchanged shall be equal or equalized as prescribed by this bill. The Trust Authority shall agree to pay, without compensation, all costs associated with each phase of the land exchange, including: (1) all costs to complete land surveys, appraisals, and environmental reviews specified in this bill so that the exchange may be completed by the deadlines for the completion of each of the phases; and (2) on request by USDA, reimbursement of costs for appropriate agency staff, additional agency staff, or third-party contractors so that the exchange may be completed by those deadlines.  Unless otherwise agreed to by USDA and the Trust Authority, land surveys shall not be required for: (1) any portion of the boundaries of the nonfederal land that is contiguous to existing National Forest System land or land that has been surveyed or lotted; (2) any portion of the boundaries of the federal land that is contiguous to land owned by the Trust Authority or the state of Alaska, or land that has been surveyed or lotted; (3) any portion of the boundaries that USDA and the Trust Authority agree is adequately defined by a survey, mapping, or aliquot part, or other legal description; and (4) any portion of the boundaries of the nonfederal land that the United States tentatively conveyed to the state without a survey, is being reconveyed to the United States in the land exchange, and is unsurveyed as of the date of enactment of this bill.  The bill states that, if a portion of a parcel of the federal or nonfederal land to be conveyed cannot be conveyed because of the presence of hazardous materials, that portion shall be removed from the exchange and the final values for such lands shall be equalized in accordance with this bill.  (Sec. 5) Upon conveyance of the federal lands to the Trust Authority, they shall become the property of the Trust Authority and be available for any uses permitted under applicable law.  Upon conveyance of the nonfederal lands by USDA, they shall become part of Tongass National Forest and be managed to: (1) preserve their undeveloped natural character and wildlife, watershed, and scenic values; and (2) provide for recreational opportunities consistent with the purposes and values for them to be preserved, including the development or maintenance of recreational trails for hiking, biking, or skiing.  Upon acquisition of the nonfederal lands by USDA, the boundaries of Tongass National Forest shall be adjusted to reflect their inclusion.  Upon acquisition of the P-1A parcel of the nonfederal land, USDA must set aside 42 acres of such parcel in a specified location as an administrative site for purposes of the future administrative needs of the Tongass National Forest.   (Sec. 6) The nonfederal land acquired by USDA under this bill shall be withdrawn from: (1) entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) disposition under the mineral leasing, mineral materials, and geothermal leasing laws.  (Sec. 7) The bill revokes any public land order or administrative action that withdraws the federal land from appropriation or disposal under a public land law to the extent necessary to permit conveyance.  If the federal land or any federal interest in the nonfederal land is not withdrawn or segregated from entry and appropriation under a public land law (including logging and mineral leasing laws and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970), such land or interest shall be withdrawn, without further action by USDA, from entry and appropriation.  Such a withdrawal shall be terminated: (1) upon the completion of the phase of the land exchange covering the applicable federal land; or (2) if the Trust Authority notifies USDA in writing that it elects to withdraw from that phase of the exchange in accordance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, when USDA receives such notice.","Alaska Mental Health Trust Land Exchange Act of 2017 (Sec. 2) This bill states that its purpose is to facilitate and expedite the exchange of land between the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority (Trust Authority) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA).

The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act of 2017 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to revise the objectives of the civilian nuclear energy research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs of the Department of Energy (DOE) to emphasize : (1) providing research infrastructure to promote scientific progress and enable users from academia, the National Laboratories, and the private sector to make scientific discoveries relevant for nuclear, chemical, and materials science engineering; and (2) enabling the private sector to partner with the National Laboratories to demonstrate novel reactor concepts for the purpose of resolving technical uncertainty associated with the aforementioned objectives.  The bill repeals the Nuclear Power 2010 Program, and makes technical corrections removing the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology as the designated entity to conduct the research, development, and demonstration programs on advanced fuel recycling technology and cost-effective technologies for increasing the safety and security of nuclear facilities. (The Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology was replaced in DOE by the Office of Nuclear Energy, the Office of Science, and the Office of Technology Transitions.)   The bill repeals requirements for development of a comprehensive plan for the operation and maintenance of its facilities at the Idaho National Laboratory to support civilian nuclear energy research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs, including radiological facilities management, isotope production, and facilities management.  By December 31, 2017, DOE shall determine the mission need for a versatile reactor-based fast neutron source, which shall operate as a national user facility.  DOE shall ensure that the user facility will provide at a minimum: (1) fast neutron spectrum irradiation capability, and (2) capacity for upgrades to accommodate new or expanded research needs.  DOE shall leverage from the Office of Science the best practices for management, construction, and operation of national user facilities.  DOE shall carry out a program for enhancing the capability to develop new reactor technologies through high-performance computation modeling and simulation techniques. Such program shall coordinate with relevant federal agencies through the National Strategic Computing Initiative while taking into account specified objectives.   The bill authorizes a program to enable the testing and demonstration of reactor concepts to be proposed and funded by the private sector. DOE shall leverage the technical expertise of relevant federal agencies and the National Laboratories in order to minimize the time required to enable construction and operation of privately funded experimental reactors at national laboratories or other DOE-owned sites.  Such reactors shall operate to enable physical validation of advanced nuclear reactor concepts and generate research and development to improve nascent technologies.  DOE may enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in order to share technical expertise and knowledge through:  testing and demonstration of advanced nuclear reactor concepts to be proposed and funded by the private sector, operating a database to store and share data and knowledge relevant to nuclear science and engineering between federal agencies and the private sector, developing and testing electric and nonelectric integration and energy conversion systems relevant to advanced nuclear reactors, leveraging expertise from the NRC respecting safety analysis, and  enabling the technical staff of the NRC to actively observe and learn about technologies developed under such testing and demonstration program.   The NRC and DOE shall enter into another memorandum of understanding to ensure that:   DOE has sufficient technical expertise to support the timely research, development, demonstration, and commercial application by the civilian nuclear industry of safe and innovative advanced nuclear technology; and  the NRC has sufficient technical expertise to assist in the evaluation of applications for licenses, permits, and design certifications and other requests for regulatory approval for advanced nuclear reactors.   Also, the NRC and DOE shall enter into such memorandum regarding:   the use of computers and software codes to calculate the behavior and performance of advanced nuclear reactors, and  ensuring that DOE maintains and develops the necessary facilities to enable timely research, development, demonstration, and commercial application by the civilian nuclear industry of safe and innovative reactor technology, and that the NRC has access to those facilities, as needed.   DOE shall assess its capabilities to authorize, host, and oversee privately funded experimental advanced nuclear reactors at national laboratories or other DOE-owned sites.  The bill subjects any activities carried out under such testing and demonstration program which involves the risk of public liability to the financial protection or indemnification requirements under the Price-Anderson Act.  Within 1 year of this bill's enactment, DOE must submit to Congress 2 specified alternative 10-year budget plans for civilian nuclear energy research and development by DOE, one assuming constant annual funding for 10 years at the appropriated FY2016 level, and the other an unconstrained budget.  DOE must also identify to Congress: (1) engineering designs for innovative fusion energy systems that have the potential to demonstrate net energy production within 15 years of the start of construction, and (2) budgetary requirements necessary for DOE to carry out a fusion innovation initiative to accelerate research and development of those designs.  (Sec. 3) DOE shall establish an Advanced Nuclear Energy Cost-Share Grant Program, under which it shall make cost-share grants to applicants to fund a portion of the applicant's NRC fees for pre-application and application review activities.  DOE shall: (1) seek out technology diversity in making such grants, and (2) determine each grant's cost-share amount. Grant recipients may use their grant funds to cover NRC fees, including those associated with developing a licensing project plan, obtaining a statement of licensing feasibility, reviewing topical reports, other pre-application and application review activities, and interactions with the NRC.  The bill authorizes appropriations to DOE to carry out such grant program. ","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced.

The summary of that version is repeated here.) Highlights:  This concurrent resolution establishes the FY2017 congressional budget resolution, which provides a framework for congressional consideration of revenue, spending, and other budget-related legislation. The budget resolution is a nonbinding framework used by Congress and cannot be signed into law or vetoed by the President.  The resolution establishes budget enforcement procedures by setting forth rules for applying budget points of order to various legislative proposals. It also includes reconciliation instructions directing various congressional committees to submit to the congressional budget committees deficit reduction legislation, which Congress must then consider using expedited legislative procedures.  The resolution includes reserve funds that provide the chairmen of the congressional budget committees with flexibility in applying budget enforcement rules to health care legislation that meets specified criteria.  Full Summary:  Establishes the congressional budget for the federal government for FY2017 and sets forth budgetary levels for FY2018-FY2026.  TITLE I--RECOMMENDED LEVELS AND AMOUNTS  Subtitle A--Budgetary Levels in Both Houses  (Sec. 1101) Recommends levels and amounts for FY2017-FY2026 for:    federal revenues,   new budget authority,   budget outlays,   deficits,   public debt, and   debt held by the public.   (Sec. 1102) Recommends levels of new budget authority and outlays for FY2017-FY2026 for each major functional category, including:    National Defense;   International Affairs;   General Science, Space, and Technology;   Energy;   Natural Resources and Environment;   Agriculture;   Commerce and Housing Credit;   Transportation;   Community and Regional Development;   Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services;   Health;   Medicare;   Income Security;   Social Security;   Veterans Benefits and Services;   Administration of Justice;   General Government;   Net Interest;   Allowances; and   Undistributed Offsetting Receipts.   Subtitle B--Levels and Amounts in the Senate  (Sec. 1201) Recommends Senate levels for FY2017-FY2026 for Social Security revenues, outlays, and administrative expenses.  (Sec. 1202) Recommends Senate levels of new budget authority and outlays for FY2017-FY2026 for U.S. Postal Service discretionary administrative expenses.  TITLE II--RECONCILIATION  (Title II includes reconciliation instructions directing congressional committees to submit deficit reduction legislation to the budget committees. Under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)  (Sec. 2001) Includes reconciliation instructions directing the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to each submit to the Senate Budget Committee legislation to reduce the deficit by at least $1 billion over the FY2017-FY2026 period. Requires the legislation to be submitted by January 27, 2017.  (Sec. 2002) Includes reconciliation instructions directing the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee to each submit to the House Budget Committee legislation to reduce the deficit by at least $1 billion over the FY2017-FY2026 period. Requires the legislation to be submitted by January 27, 2017.  TITLE III--RESERVE FUNDS  Establishes reserve funds that provide the chairmen of the congressional budget committees with flexibility in applying budget enforcement rules to health care legislation that meets specified criteria. (Under the reserve funds, the chairmen may revise committee allocations, aggregates and other appropriate levels in this resolution, and the pay-as-you-go [PAYGO] ledger in the Senate.)  (Sec. 3001) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for health care legislation that would not increase the deficit over the FY2017-FY2016 period.  (Sec. 3002) Establishes a reserve fund for health care legislation. Specifies that the adjustments permitted under this section may not exceed the difference obtained from subtracting $2 billion from the sum of deficit reduction over the period of the total of fiscal years FY2017-FY2026 achieved under legislation for which the chairman has exercised authority under the deficit-neutral reserve fund in section 3001.  Specifies that, in the House and the Senate, legislation for which the chairman of the applicable budget committee has exercised authority pursuant to this section is exempt from: (1) the point of order against legislation increasing the short-term deficit, and (2) the point of order against legislation increasing long-term deficits or direct spending.  (The short-term deficit point of order prohibits the Senate from considering legislation that would cause a net increase in the deficit in excess of $10 billion in any fiscal year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution unless it is fully offset over the period of all fiscal years provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution.  The long-term point of order applies to legislation that would cause a net-increase in on budget-deficits in the Senate or a net increase in direct spending in the House in excess of $5 billion in any of the 4 consecutive 10-year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 years after the budget year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution.)  TITLE IV-OTHER MATTERS  (Sec. 4001) Provides that, for the purposes of enforcing the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the chairmen of the congressional budget committees may submit for publication in the Congressional Record allocations that are normally included in the joint statement of managers accompanying a conference report.  (Sec. 4002) Provides that the discretionary administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service are reflected in the allocation to the appropriations committees to ensure that the committees retain control over the expenses through the annual appropriations process. Requires the administrative expenses to be included in the cost estimates for appropriations legislation for budget enforcement purposes.  (Sec. 4003) Sets forth procedures for adjustments of the allocations and aggregates included in the budget resolution. Specifies that legislation for which the House Budget Committee Chairman has made adjustments or revisions in the allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary levels of this concurrent resolution is exempt from: (1) the Cut-As-You-Go point of order, and (2) the point of order against legislation increasing long-term direct spending.  (The Cut-As-You-Go point of order prohibits the House from considering legislation that would have the net effect of increasing direct spending over specified time periods.  The long-term point of order prohibits the House from considering legislation that would cause a net increase in direct spending in excess of $5 billion in any of the 4 consecutive 10-year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 years after the budget year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution.  This provision effectively allows the House Budget Committee Chairman to exempt from the points of order health care legislation that qualifies for the reserve funds in title III.)  (Sec. 4004) Affirms that this budget resolution is adopted as an exercise of the rulemaking powers of the House and Senate and that either chamber has the constitutional right to change these rules.

The summary of that version is repeated here.) Making Opportunities for Broadband Investment and Limiting Excessive and Needless Obstacles to Wireless Act or the MOBILE NOW Act  (Sec. 3) This bill requires the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), by December 31, 2020, to make available at least 255 megahertz of federal and nonfederal spectrum below the frequency of 6000 megahertz for mobile and fixed wireless broadband use. At least: (1) 100 megahertz shall be made available on an unlicensed basis; and (2) 100 megahertz shall be made available on an exclusive, licensed basis for commercial mobile use, pursuant to the FCC's authority to implement licensing in a flexible manner, and subject to potential continued use of such spectrum by incumbent federal entities in designated geographic areas indefinitely or for a length of time stipulated in transition plans approved by an NTIA technical panel for those incumbent entities to relocate to alternate spectrum. In making such spectrum available, the Department of Commerce and the FCC must consider: (1) the need to preserve critical existing and planned federal government capabilities; (2) the impact on existing state, local, and tribal government capabilities; (3) international implications; (4) appropriate enforcement mechanisms and authorities; and (5) the importance of the deployment of wireless broadband services in rural areas. (Sec. 4) The NTIA must submit to Congress and the FCC an assessment of the feasibility of authorizing mobile or fixed terrestrial wireless operations, including for advanced mobile service operations, on federal entities and operations in specified frequency bands. The FCC must publish a notice of proposed rulemaking within two years after enactment of this bill, or within 90 days after it receives the NTIA's feasibility assessment, whichever is earlier, to consider service rules authorizing such operations. (Sec. 5) Commerce and the FCC must submit reports evaluating the feasibility of allowing commercial wireless services to share use of specified frequencies between 3100 and 4200 megahertz. If such sharing is feasible, the reports must identify which of the frequencies are most suitable for sharing with commercial wireless services through the assignment of new licenses by competitive bidding, for sharing with unlicensed operations, or through a combination of licensing and unlicensed operations. The FCC must seek public comment regarding these reports.  (Sec. 6) The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 is amended to require executive agencies, within 270 days after receiving an application, to grant or deny easements, rights-of-way, or leases to, in, over, or on federal property to install, construct, modify, or maintain a communications facility installation. Executive agencies must: (1) notify applicants of the reasons for denials, and (2) designate an agency point of contact for applicants. The bill expands the categories of infrastructure, antennas, wiring, and wireless transmission equipment for which applicants may seek such easements, rights-of-way, or leases. The NTIA must coordinate with the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Defense, and Transportation (DOT), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the General Services Administration to develop recommendations for tracking and expediting such applications. (Sec. 7) To facilitate installation of broadband infrastructure, DOT must ensure that states receiving federal-aid highway funds: (1) identify a broadband utility coordinator to facilitate the broadband infrastructure right-of-way efforts within the state; (2) register broadband infrastructure entities that seek to be included in those facilitation efforts; (3) establish a process to electronically notify such entities of the state transportation improvement program on an annual basis; (4) coordinate statewide telecommunication and broadband plans and state and local transportation and land use plans, including strategies to minimize repeated excavations that involve the installation of broadband infrastructure in a right-of-way; and (5) ensure that any existing broadband infrastructure entities are not disadvantaged. Nothing in this section establishes a mandate or requirement that a state install broadband infrastructure in a highway right-of-way. (Sec. 8) The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) must establish a single database of real property owned, leased, or managed by executive agencies that is capable of supporting a communications facility installation. The OSTP must make the database available to: (1) entities that construct or operate communications facility installations or provide communications service, and (2) state and local governments so that they may provide information regarding state and local properties to include in the database. The OSTP must report to Congress regarding potential ways to incentivize state and local governments to provide such information. (Sec. 9) After notice and an opportunity for public comment, Commerce must submit recommendations to incentivize federal entities to relinquish, or share with federal or nonfederal users, federal spectrum for commercial wireless broadband services. It must consider whether permitting eligible federal entities to accept payments could expedite access to eligible frequencies. (Sec. 10) The FCC must collaborate with the NTIA to determine the best means of providing federal entities flexible access to nonfederal spectrum on a shared basis across a range of short-, mid-, and long-range time frames, including for intermittent purposes like emergency use. (Sec. 11) After public notice and comment, the FCC must adopt rules that permit unlicensed services to use guard bands designated to protect frequencies allocated by competitive bidding if it would not cause harmful interference.  (Sec. 12) The OMB may provide pre-auction funding to federal agencies for auctions intended to occur within eight years (currently, five years) after the transfer of funds. (Sec. 13) Federal entities may request an immediate transfer of funds to pay for relocation or sharing costs after the frequencies are reallocated by competitive bidding. (Sec. 14) The FCC must provide notice and an opportunity for public comment before it submits reports regarding: (1) the results of rule changes relating to the frequencies between 3550 and 3650 megahertz, and (2) proposals to promote and identify additional spectrum bands that can be shared between incumbent uses and new licensed and unlicensed services under such rules and that identify at least 1 gigahertz between 6 gigahertz and 57 gigahertz for such use. (Sec. 15) The Government Accountability Office must recommend policies to increase the availability of broadband Internet access using unlicensed spectrum and wireless networks in low-income neighborhoods, particularly for elementary and secondary school-aged children. (Sec. 16) The FCC must assess whether to establish a program, or modify existing programs, under which a licensee that receives a license for the exclusive use of spectrum in a specific geographic area may partition or disaggregate the license by sale or long-term lease to provide services consistent with the license and make unused spectrum available to: (1) unaffiliated small carriers with not more than 1,500 employees, or (2) other unaffiliated carriers to serve rural areas. (Sec. 17) The bill declares that it is U.S. policy to: (1) maximize U.S. spectrum resources to benefit U.S. people, (2) advance wireless broadband innovation and investment, and (3) make available on an unlicensed basis radio frequency bands sufficient to meet consumer demand. The FCC must ensure that its spectrum allocation and assignment efforts make available on an unlicensed basis radio frequency bands sufficient to meet demand for unlicensed wireless broadband operations if doing so is reasonable and in the public interest after taking into account the future needs of other spectrum users. (Sec. 18) The FCC must develop a national plan for making additional radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations. The NTIA must recommend reforms to the Spectrum Relocation Fund to address federal entities sharing costs and expenditures under the plan. Spectrum Challenge Prize Act (Sec. 19) The NTIA must conduct prize competitions to accelerate the development and commercialization of technology that improves spectrum efficiency and is capable of cost-effective deployment.  Not more than $5 million, in the aggregate, may be awarded to prize competition winners.  The FCC must publish a technical paper providing criteria that may be used for the design of such competitions. Wireless Telecommunications Tax and Fee Collection Fairness Act (Sec. 20) State and local jurisdictions are prohibited from requiring a person to collect from, or remit on behalf of, any other person a state or local tax, fee, or surcharge imposed on the purchase or use of any wireless telecommunications service within the state unless the collection or remittance is in connection with a financial transaction in which the purchaser or user upon whom a tax, fee, or surcharge is imposed gives cash, credit, or any other exchange of monetary value or consideration to the person who is required to collect or remit the tax, fee, or surcharge.
